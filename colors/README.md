"Colors" gives the user a visual of their desired input by instantly displaying it through the background. It also:
• Translates RGBA colors to Hexadecimals and vice versa
• Grants user ability to save, edit and remove color bubbles which display hexadecimal and RGBA values
• Utilizes the YIQ Color Model to determine text color of each saved color bubble
• Generates random colors and gets the inverse of the current background color.
